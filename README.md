# CSE251B-PA1
The files are for PA1
The 5b, 5c, and 5d are for the logistic regression
three_learning_rate is used for the plotting only and relies on data stored locaaly adfter running 5c
6a is for softmax regerssion with batch gradent descent
6b is for softmax regerssion with stochastic gradent descent
Simply run each file to obtain results
Since we shuffle the data in k-fold validation, the plots might be different from the plots we show in our reports
